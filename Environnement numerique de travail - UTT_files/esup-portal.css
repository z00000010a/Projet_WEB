/* uPORTAL PORTAL CSS
 * These declarations are scoped for the portal, and not specifically for portlets.
 * For portlet-specifc CSS, see "portlet.css" in the same directory.
 * CSS specified at the portal scope will naturally cascade into portlets.
 * This CSS assumes the use of a CSS reset (by default the FSS "fss-reset.css") for browser normalization.
 */
 
/* uPORTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
 * For the standards and guidelines that govern the user interface of uPortal portlets including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibilty, naming conventions, 3rd Party libraries (like jQuery and the Fluid Skinning System) and more, refer to:
 * http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/x/cQ

/* ICONS
 * This CSS uses the Silk icon set 1.3 by Mark James:

 * which is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License:
 * http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/
 * This icon set is free for use under the CCA 2.5 license, so long as there

------------------------------------
  Fluid Skinning System overrides.
------------------------------------
 * The Fluid Skinning System is a group of CSS files with a specially designed modular structure and class-specific format.
 * It is meant to work well as both a standalone CSS foundation for your site and Fluid Infusion components.
 * In FSS, "themes" refer to the color schemes and "window dressings" for basic markup and FSS Helpers, such as Tabs, Widgets, Menus, etc.
 * For more information on FSS themes, refer to:
 * http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/egNS
 * uPortal skins generally use a FSS theme as the base CSS styling for the portal. 
 * If a FSS theme is used with this skin, it is specified in skin.xml and applied first (from the resource server).
 * These are any overrides to the FSS theme.
 */
 
 /* ESUP-Portail additional styles
  * These declarations override or add to portal.css declarations
  * esup-portal.css must be declared in skin.xml, after portal.css
